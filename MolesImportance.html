    <h2>Why moles are important to chemistry?</h2>

    <p>
        The reason moles are significant is because they allow us to convert 
        numbers of moles in a sample to a mass, for example, if we know the number of 
        moles of NaCl, we can figure out what its mass is in grams and vice versa. 
        To do this, we can use this triangle to help us figure out what equation to use.(scroll down to view examples)

    <h2>Example one(finding number of molecules given moles):</h2>
    <p>If there is a question that says, how many molecules are there in 2 moles
         of hydrogen? All we need to do is multiply the number of moles by Avogadro's
          number. Since 2 * 6.022 * 10^23 = 1.2044 * 1024 (note that we must keep the 
          sig figs the same as the smallest amount of sig figs 1.2044 * 10^24 in this 
          case it would be 1.204 * 10^24), therefore there are 1.204 * 10^24 in 2 moles of hydrogen.
    </p>


    <h2>Example two(finding moles given number of molecules):</h2>
    <p>If there is a question like how many moles are there in 2.5*10^20 
        molecules of H2O? All we need to do is divide the amounts of molecules 
        by Avogadro's number. In this case, it would be 2.5 * 10^20 molecules / 6.022 
        * 10^23 molecules/mols, leaving us with 4.151444703 * 10^-4 (note that we must 
        keep the sig figs the same as the smallest amount of sig figs 4.151444703 * 10^-4, 
        in this case, it would be 4.151 * 10^-4).</p>
        
    <h2>Example three (finding mass given moles):</h2>
    <p>If, we are told that there are 5 moles of NaCl and to 
        convert that to grams. First, we figure out what the 
        molar mass is, this can be done by looking at its atomic
        mass, because one MM(molar mass) of an element is equal 
        to its atomic mass. In addition, the MM of NaCl is 22.99(the atomic mass 
        of Na) plus 35.45 (the atomic mass of Cl) the molar mass would be 58.44. 
        Now that we know its molar mass to convert it to grams, we can look at the 
        triangle to figure out what equation to use. Since we have the molar mass and 
        the number of moles, we can use this equation MM * n = m. Lastly, we can plug
        everything into the equation and solve for the mass, 58.44 * 5 = 292.2 g (note 
        that we must keep the sig figs the same as the smallest amount of sig figs 292.2 in 
        this case it would stay the same), now we can finish with our concluding statement, 
        therefore, there are 292.2grams of NaCl in 5 moles worth of NaCl.
    </p>

    <h2>Example four (finding moles given mass):</h2>
    <p>
        If, a question asks how many moles there are in 80g 
        of HNO3? First, we figure out the molar mass we can
        do this the way learned in example three (note that
        oxygen's atomic mass must be multiplied by three). 
        Now that we know the molar mass, we can look at the triangle 
        to figure out what equation to use, in this case, we would use
        m/MM = n. Next, we plug everything into the equation 80.0 g / 
        6.302*10^1 g/mols = 1.269438274 mols (note that we must keep the s
        ig figs the same as the smallest amount of sig figs 1.269438274, 
        in this case, would be 1.27), therefore, there are 1.27 moles in 80.0 g
        of nitric acid. (Great job after reading these example you are ready to take on the test
